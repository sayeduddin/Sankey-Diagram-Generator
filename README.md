# Sankey-Diagram-Generator

This aim of this project is to draw sankey diagrams using the ezgraphics module. All the lines and colours are drawn by the ezgraphics turtle. Diagram data is extracted from txt files and then processed to produce the diagrams. 

# Sankey_Original
Draws sankey diagrams with straight bars and assigns random colours to each bar. 

# Sankey_Additional
Draws sankey diagrams with curved bars and uses additional colour data from the txt files to assign appropriate colours. 

# Sankey_Tests
Runs tests to ensure that all aspects of Sankey_Additional.py are functioning as expected.
